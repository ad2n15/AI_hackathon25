Abstract

Mediator, a co-regulator complex required for RNA Polymerase II activity, interacts with tissue-specific transcription factors to regulate development and maintain homeostasis. We observe reduced Mediator subunit MED15 expression in endocrine hormone-producing pancreatic islets isolated from people living with type 2 diabetes and sought to understand how MED15 and Mediator control gene expression programs important for the function of insulin-producing β-cells. Here we show that Med15 is expressed during mouse β-cell development and maturation. Knockout of Med15 in mouse β-cells causes defects in β-cell maturation without affecting β-cell mass or insulin expression. ChIP-seq and co-immunoprecipitation analyses found that Med15 binds β-cell transcription factors Nkx6-1 and NeuroD1 to regulate key β-cell maturation genes. In support of a conserved role during human development, human embryonic stem cell-derived β-like cells, genetically engineered to express high levels of MED15, express increased levels of maturation markers. We provide evidence of a conserved role for Mediator in β-cell maturation and demonstrate an additional layer of control that tunes β-cell transcription factor function.

The establishment of glucose-regulated insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells requires multiple transcription factors but is incompletely understood. Here, the authors show that Mediator complex subunit MED15 is vital for this process of β-cell maturation, highlighting its role in coordinating transcriptional control of insulin production and secretion.
Introduction

Pancreatic islet β-cells that secrete insulin to maintain physiological blood glucose levels are destroyed or become dysfunctional in Type 1 (T1D) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), respectively. Although embryonic and neonatal β-cells produce insulin, their glucose responsiveness is blunted, and they secrete more insulin at lower glucose levels compared to adult β-cells; this elevated basal secretion may be required to facilitate rapid growth early in life1. Functional maturation, defined by glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in the adult physiological glucose range (5–10 mM), is accompanied by a number of changes to β-cell physiology. These include: (1) a shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation2; (2) a reduction in basal insulin secretion accompanied by a reduction in β-cell glucose sensitivity2; (3) reduced fasting insulin secretion and potentially a reduction in responsiveness to non-glucose secretagogues2,3; (4) reduced β-cell proliferation4,5; and (5) establishment of proper intra-islet paracrine interactions through the expression of Ucn31,6. Maturation is also accompanied by an improved capacity to synthesize and store insulin, which may be facilitated by more efficient zinc-mediated crystallization in the secretory granule7. Functional maturation is achieved through the expression of transcription factors such as Mafa, Pax6, NeuroD1, Nkx6-1, Errγ, Pdx1, Six2, and Six38–14. Mutations in some of these factors lead to monogenic forms of diabetes, demonstrating the importance of proper transcriptional regulation for β-cell maturation15.

Transcription factors exert their actions through RNA Polymerase II (Pol II). Thus, interactions that bridge DNA-bound transcription factors to RNA Pol II play a critical role in transcriptional regulation. Transcription factor function can be controlled by Mediator, a 25–31 subunit complex required for RNA Pol II-dependent transcription16. Mediator can change conformation based on its binding partners, and certain subunits can associate or dissociate without perturbing its core integrity16–20. Functionally, conformation changes allow Mediator to drive specific gene programs, and—depending on specific transcription factor-Mediator interactions—allow engagement at many different promoters21,22. Mediator is composed of four distinct modules: the head, middle, tail, and kinase modules19,23,24. Structure-function analyses in yeast have determined that the middle and head modules are essential for transcription, with the kinase and tail modules serving regulatory functions18,25. The tail module serves as a direct link to transcription factors26,27, although transcription factors also contact Mediator subunits in other modules.

The tail module subunit Med15 is a conserved regulator of lipid metabolism through its interaction with sterol response element binding protein (SREBP-1)28. The Med15–SREBP-1 physical and functional interaction is conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans, with orthologs MDT-15 and SBP-1 regulating lipid metabolism and protecting against glucotoxicity29. Furthermore, C. elegans MDT-15 protects from hypoxia and oxidative stress through interactions with the transcription factors NHR-49 and SKN-1, orthologs of HNF4α and NRF230–33. Notably, hypoxia and oxidative stress can also occur in β-cells of patients with T2D34–36.

Because Med15 orthologs participate in these processes and interact with molecular partners relevant to β-cell development and maturation, we hypothesized that Med15—at least partly through its important role in Mediator—may act as a nexus that couples β-cell-specific transcription factors to core promoters to regulate β-cell maturation and function. In the present study, we demonstrate that Med15 is expressed in islets and that its expression is reduced in individuals with T2D. In mice, deletion of Med15 in β-cells resulted in severe glucose intolerance due to impaired β-cell maturation. We further show that Med15 is associated with unique regions of the genome that include consensus binding sites for several transcription factors essential for β-cell maturation, including Nkx6-1 and NeuroD1. Med15 can physically interact with these two transcription factors. Lastly, we genetically engineered human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to express increased levels of MED15; β-like cells derived from these hESCs showed markers of improved β-cell maturation. Collectively, these data identify Mediator family member Med15 as a conserved β-cell coactivator required for efficient maturation.
Results
Med15 is expressed in mouse and human pancreatic cells and its expression is decreased in islets from individuals with T2D

As the role of Med15/Mediator has not previously been characterized in the pancreas, we performed qPCR and immunofluorescence analysis on mouse embryonic and adult pancreata. We found that Med15 was highly expressed at E12.5–-E17.5 and in P1-8-week-old islets (Figs. 1A, S1). At E13.5, Med15 was nuclear and highly expressed in nascent insulin-positive β-cells but not in glucagon-positive α-cells (Fig. 1B). E18.5 staining demonstrated nuclear Med15 expression in some β-cells and in α-cells (Fig. 1C). Eight-week-old adult islets also showed nuclear Med15 expression (Fig. 1D) in both α- and β-cells. To confirm expression in human insulin-producing cells, we performed Western blots and readily detected Med15 expression in human and mouse islets, as well as in MIN6 insulinoma and hESC derived islet cells (Fig. 1E).

NanoString gene expression analysis of islets from donors diagnosed with T2D revealed that MED15 expression was significantly decreased compared to islets from healthy donors, along with glucose sensing and metabolism genes such as glucose transporters GLUT1, GLUT2 (SLC2A1, SLC2A2), glucokinase (GCK), and hormones insulin (INS) and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), suggesting a role for MED15 and/or Mediator in adult β-cell function and pathogenesis of T2D (Supplementary Data 1; Figs. 1F, S2). Conversely, α-cell genes such as GCG, ARX, and MAFB; δ-cell genes SST and MNX1; and the early endocrine marker NEUROG3 were unchanged or significantly increased in T2D (Figs. 1F, S2). These data show conserved expression of MED15 in insulin-producing β-cells and suggest a role for MED15 in β-cell development, maturation, or functional maintenance.
Med15 ablation impairs glucose tolerance and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in mice

To test whether Med15 affects glucose homeostasis in vivo, we deleted it in nascent mouse β-cells using the Ins1Cre β-cell-specific knock-in line37, generating M15betaKO mice (Fig. 2A). To control for gene dosage of insulin, control mice were Ins1Cre/+; Med15+/+ (CTRL) unless otherwise stated. We confirmed β-cell-specific knockout with immunofluorescence (Fig. 2B) and observed no change in body weight (Fig. S3A). Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests at 3, 6, and 8 weeks of age revealed that both male and female M15betaKO mice were glucose intolerant and had significantly reduced serum insulin levels (Figs. 2C, D, S3B–D), suggesting defective β-cell mass or function. To quantify β-cell mass, we performed morphometric analyses on pancreata of 8-week M15betaKO mice; we found that they showed no change in gross islet morphology, insulin-positive β-cells, glucagon-positive α-cells, or total pancreatic cells (Figs. 2E, S3F–H). However, we did observe a significant increase in β-cell proliferation in 3-week-old M15betaKO islets (Fig. S3E), which may indicate impaired β-cell maturation. To assess insulin secretion, we carried out perifusion experiments on islets of 8-week-old knockout mice. M15betaKO islets had impaired first- and second-phase insulin secretion yet displayed no difference in total insulin content (Figs. 2F, G,  S3I, J). To bypass the early steps in GSIS, islets were stimulated with α-ketoglutarate or KCl. M15betaKO islets displayed normal insulin secretion with either secretagogue (Figs. 2F,  S3I), suggesting a defect upstream of mitochondrial metabolism. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Med15 and/or Mediator is required for β-cell function.

Loss of Med15 impairs the expression of β-cell maturation genes and glucose uptake

To define how the loss of Med15 affects the islet transcriptome, we performed RNA-seq on islets from 8-week control (Ins1+/+; Med15fl/fl) and M15betaKO mice. The most significantly downregulated genes in M15betaKO islets included cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIa polypeptide 2 (Cox6a2) encoding a mitochondrial ETC component, β-cell maturation markers urocortin 3 (Ucn3) and transcription factor Mafa, glucose transporter Slc2a2/Glut2, and endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductase 1β (Ero1lb), which is important for disulfide bond formation during insulin maturation (Supplementary Data 2; Fig. 3A)38. In agreement with the RNA-seq data, M15betaKO islets showed complete loss of Mafa, Ucn3, and Glut2 immunostaining (Fig. 3B), which are markers of glucose-responsive β-cells1,12,39, at all stages tested (P1-8 weeks; Fig. S4). Collectively, these results demonstrate that M15betaKO islets fail to express key β-cell genes required for functional maturity. To assess a functional marker of immaturity, we studied insulin granule morphology in M15betaKO cells by electron microscopy. We found that M15betaKO islets have significantly fewer and smaller dense core insulin granules (Fig. 3C–E), indicating a lack of insulin granule and β-cell maturation, likely due to reduced Slc30a8 expression and impaired zinc concentration and insulin crystallization within the granules. These data show that Med15, potentially through its role within Mediator, is required for β-cell maturation.

Throughout, error bars represent mean ± SEM. Source data are provided as Source_Data.xlsx.

Because we observed reduced expression of mitochondrial proteins Cox6a2 and Ndufs2 and increased expression of Ucp2 upon loss of Med15 (Supplementary Data 2), we next tested whether loss of Med15 impaired mitochondrial function. We found that islets from M15betaKO show reduced glucose-stimulated oxygen consumption (Fig. 3F), but no change in maximal respiration (Fig. 3G), suggesting no functional mitochondrial impairment. In agreement with the insulin secretion data, mitochondrial membrane potential, as measured by fluorescent probe tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) normalized to mitochondrial mass marker MitoTracker Green (MTG) (Fig. S5A), was significantly reduced in islets from M15betaKO mice upon stimulation with glucose, but not following stimulation with the mitochondrial substrate α-ketoglutarate (Fig. S5B). To examine possible differences in mitochondrial networking, we analyzed three-dimensional mitochondrial morphology in control and M15betaKO islets using confocal microscopy. This revealed reduced mitochondrial count per cell (Fig. S5C, D) yet increased mitochondrial volume (Fig. S5E) in islets from M15betaKO mice, suggesting altered mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics that likely result from β-cell immaturity.

As islets from M15betaKO mice have significantly reduced Slc2a2 expression levels (Figs. 3B, S4), we tested whether they showed normal glucose uptake. Studying dispersed islets incubated with the fluorescent glucose analog 2-NBDG, we found that M15betaKO had impaired glucose uptake compared to control islets (Fig. 3H). These data support and provide a mechanistic understanding of the significant reduction in GSIS in M15betaKO islets (Fig. 2F). Altogether, we find that loss of Med15, and potentially Mediator function, in nascent β-cells, leads to impaired glucose uptake and impaired functional maturation.
Med15 cooperates with β-cell transcription factors to regulate the β-cell transcriptome

As highlighted above, expression of mature β-cell markers Ucn3 and Mafa and genes encoding key metabolic machinery such as Slc2a2, Ero1lb, and G6pc2 were reduced in Med15-deficient islets (Figs. 3, 4A, S4, S5). Gene set enrichment analysis identified β-cell hallmark genes as the most strongly impaired gene set following Med15 knockout in β-cells (Fig. 4B). Moreover, downregulation of the unfolded protein response and protein secretion and glycolysis pathways (Fig. 4B) support a transcriptional basis underlying decrements in mature insulin granule density (Fig. 3C–E) and insulin secretion we observed in M15betaKO β-cells (Fig. 2F); whereas, reduced steady-state expression of cell cycle-regulating genes in the G2/M checkpoint and E2F target gene sets (Fig. 4B) suggest a transcriptional basis for the increase in cell replication (Fig. S3E). Reduced expression of the mTOR and AKT pathways, which facilitate β-cell maturation in response to dietary stimuli, further indicates an immature transcriptional phenotype in M15betaKO islets40,41. On the other hand, genes of the interferon response, associated with compromised β-cell function in T1D and T2D, were upregulated in M15betaKO islets (Fig. 4B)42,43. These data indicate an essential role for MED15 in establishing the mature β-cell transcriptome.

To more directly link Med15 activity with the regulation of β-cell gene expression, we mapped binding locations of Med15 and the Mediator middle module subunit Med1 in MIN6 mouse insulinoma cells using ChIP-seq44,45. We identified 47,544 genomic sites bound by Med15 and 58,193 sites bound by Med1, with roughly 10,000 of each mapping to gene promoters (Fig. 4C). Binding sites were significantly enriched at annotated gene promoters and distal enhancers (Fig. S6A). Importantly, genes with promoters targeted by Med15 tended to be downregulated in M15betaKO islets (Fig. 4D). Similarly, genes downregulated in M15betaKO islets were enriched with promoter-bound Med15, whereas upregulated genes were depleted (Fig. S6B), together supporting a role for Med15 in increasing target gene expression in β-cells. A similar pattern was observed for Med1-bound genes (Figs. 4D, S6B), consistent with the expectation that Med15 operates within the Mediator complex. Notably, we observed imperfect overlap of Med15 and Med1 binding sites in MIN6 cells (Fig. 4E), suggesting that target specificity by Mediator may be influenced by the inclusion or exclusion of Med15.

Because Med15 is a subunit of the tail module, which interacts directly with some sequence-specific transcription factors, we investigated whether known DNA binding motifs were enriched in Med15-bound loci. Motifs targeted by CTCF, E2F family proteins, the activity-regulated factors Fos, JunB and Npas4, and, notably, the mature β-cell transcription factors Nkx6-1, NeuroD1, Foxa2, Isl1, and Mafa, were overrepresented in Med15 footprints (Fig. 4F). To test if these transcription factors cooperate with Med15 to regulate target gene expression, we compared the gene expression changes in M15betaKO islets with gene expression changes following deletion of transcription factor genes identified in the motif analysis for which transcriptome data is published9,11,46–50. Genes that were dysregulated due to the deletion of Nkx6-1, Mafa, Glis3, Isl1, Neurod1, and Rfx6 were enriched in the genes dysregulated due to the deletion of Med15 (Fig. 4G). This finding is consistent with the idea that these transcription factors cooperate with Med15 to regulate gene expression, and highlighted the Nkx6-1 regulon as most similar. Next, we compared our ChIP-seq data with available ChIP-seq data of the same transcription factors in mouse islets or β-cell lines9,11,46–50. The set of genes directly targeted by Med15 and by Neurod1, Nkx6-1, Foxa2, and Glis3 strongly overlapped (Fig. 4H, I). Further, the binding intensity of each of these transcription factors was higher at promoters and enhancers where Med15 was also bound compared to promoters and enhancers bound by the transcription factor but not by Med15 (Fig. S4C). Together, these data suggest that multiple transcription factors in β-cells interact with Med15 to regulate Mediator activity and target gene expression.

The combination of DNA binding motif enrichment, transcriptome similarity, and genome-wide binding prioritized Nkx6-1 as a likely interactor of Med15. To test whether Med15 and specific transcription factors interact physically, we performed co-immunoprecipitation in MIN6 cells. We found that Med15 interacts with Nkx6-1 and NeuroD1 in MIN6 cells (Fig. 5A, B). This interaction appears to be specific to Med15 because the middle module subunit Med1 did not co-immunoprecipitate Nkx6-1 (Fig. 5A). Further analysis revealed that immobilized Nkx6-1 co-purifies with Med15, Med6, and Med12, but not with Med23 (Figs. 5C, Fig. S7A) and the Med15:Nkx6-1 interaction can be recapitulated in vitro with purified proteins (Fig. 5D). This may reflect a specific Mediator conformation or loss of Med1 and/or Med23 during purification; we note that Med15 co-purified with Med6, Med12, and Med23 in MIN6 lysates (Fig. S7B), suggesting the presence of canonical Mediator complex in these cells.

To test whether this interaction occurred in the absence of other factors, we tested the ability of purified, Flag-tagged MED15 to interact with purified, HA-tagged Nkx6-1 in vitro. We observed a specific interaction between Med15 and Nkx6-1 with multiple different protein preparations (Fig. 5D). Finally, we used AlphaFold and AlphaPulldown to model protein-protein interactions between the domains of MED15 and NKX6.1. We found two regions of potential interaction between MED15 and NKX6.1 (Figs. 5E, S8) and found that MED15 may interact with other important β-cell transcription factors, including PAX6 and NEUROD1 (Fig. S8)51,52. In sum, these data suggest that Med15 helps to coordinate Mediator interactions with multiple transcription factors at specific loci to induce critical β-cell maturation genes during β-cell maturation.
Elevated expression of MED15 in human embryonic stem cell-derived β-cells improves expression of maturation markers

To test if MED15 plays a role in human β-cell maturation, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to knock a 2A-mScarlet-MED15 expression cassette onto the INS coding region in H1 hESCs to generate a MED15 beta cell over-expression model (MED15betaOE) (Fig. S9A)53–55. These hESCs were then differentiated to stage 6 immature pancreatic β-cells54–56. MED15 overexpression did not alter β-cell differentiation as we obtained similar frequencies of insulin-expressing cells as in control differentiations (Figs. 6A,  S9B). FAC sorted β-cells from these spheroids robustly expressed RFP/mScarlet and MED15 (Figs. 6B, S9B). Additional gene expression analysis revealed that MED15betaOE spheroids expressed higher levels of several markers of β-cell maturation, including UCN3 (Fig. 6C), IAPP (Fig. 6D), INS, and SLC30A8 (Fig. 6F), but not NKX6.1 (Fig. 6E). Interestingly, five of the genes increased in MED15betaOE cells are bound and regulated by Med15 in murine islets, including SLC30A8, UCN3, IAPP, and G6PC2. Immunostaining indicated significantly higher levels of UCN3 expression in MED15betaOE insulin-expressing cells (Fig. 6G). These data demonstrate that MED15 plays a conserved role in human β-cells where it also increases the expression of markers of β-cell maturation.

Discussion

Transcription factors and regulatory networks play essential roles in the development, differentiation, maturation, and function of the pancreatic β-cells57–60. However, how individual transcription factors interface with RNA Pol II and whether these interactions can be harnessed to promote β-cell maturation has not been studied. Here, we demonstrate that the transcriptional coactivator Med15, a subunit of the evolutionarily conserved Mediator complex, is essential for β-cell maturation. We show that Med15 interacts with Nkx6-1, a transcription factor known to drive β-cell maturation11 and that Med15 occupies and regulates genes alongside β-cell transcription factors, including Nkx6-1. Notably, this includes numerous genes required for insulin secretion and biosynthesis, including Mafa, Slc2a2, Slc30a8, and G6pc2. Consequently, reductions of Med15 compromise glucose uptake, impair insulin granule maturation and result in impairments in organismal glucose homeostasis and subsequent glucose intolerance. Collectively, our data suggest a model whereby Med15, potentially through Mediator, coordinates transcriptional control of β-cell maturation.

In our mouse model, we observed that conditional loss of Med15 in β-cells impaired glucose tolerance without affecting β-cell numbers. The observed hyperglycemia is likely caused primarily by defective β-cell glucose uptake. This is supported by our functional analyses, suggesting reduced mitochondrial function under high glucose conditions, driven solely by reduced glycolytic product availability. Subtle differences in mitochondrial morphology were also observed that mirror those seen in other knockout models with impaired β-cell maturation, including the reduced mitochondrial count of Nkx6-1 knockout islets and the increased mitochondrial volume in ERRγ knockout islets61,62. Downstream of β-cell glucose uptake, we demonstrate that several genes important for insulin biogenesis, namely Ero1lb and Slc30a8, are decreased, leading to fewer dense core granules38,63. In agreement with our findings, a decrease in mature insulin secretory granule number is similarly observed in Nkx6-1 knockout islets11. Collectively, the loss of these Med15-regulated genes likely contributes to the impaired glucose tolerance observed in M15betaKO mice.

Mediator subunit interactions with transcription factor partners can selectively activate distinct gene regulatory networks in cell and developmental-specific manners64,65. Here, we show that Med15 physically interacts with Nkx6-1 and NeuroD1, but it may also bind other transcription factors at actively transcribed regions (Fig. 4F–H) to confer β-cell maturation. In contrast, Med1 did not bind Nkx6-1 in our assays, and Med1 and Med15-bound regions were often distinct (Fig. 4E, I). These results demonstrate that, in β-cells, individual Mediator subunit (e.g., Med15)::transcription factor interactions dictate how Mediator governs gene expression and cell-type specific functions.

As deletion of Med15 has a similar, yet distinct, phenotype to loss of Nkx6-1, it is likely that Med15 may have additional Nkx6-1 independent functions. For example, Mediator interacts with CTCF and the cohesin complex at intergenic boundaries to enable chromatin looping66,67. Such chromatin looping is important for pancreatic islet function and may be altered in T2D68–70. Additionally, Mediator is important for the formation of dense regions of enhancers known as super-enhancers71. Thus, future studies could determine if Med15, through its roles in Mediator, promotes enhancer-promoter looping or interactions at super-enhancers in order to drive the expression of genes required for β-cell maturation and to determine whether loss of these interactions predisposes to diabetes.

In our studies, immature hESC-derived insulin-producing cells genetically engineered to express high levels of MED15 had elevated expression of β-cell maturation markers. Of note, several of the genes upregulated in these human insulin-producing cells (SLC30A8, IAPP, UCN3, and G6PC2) were bound and regulated by Med15 in mouse islets, suggesting that these are conserved MED15 targets. However, it remains unclear how changing the amount of one Mediator subunit would affect the activity of the entire complex. We speculate that providing MED15 earlier following β-cell specification might improve maturation by increasing MED15 availability, turnover in the complex, recruitment to enhancers by transcription factors, and stability of transcriptional machinery. Further investigation into stabilizing MED15 by reducing its degradation or into modulating specific MED15-transcription factor interactions pharmacologically, as done for the MED15–SREBP interaction, may prove useful in improving the maturation of stem cell-derived β-cells for the treatment of those with insulin-dependent diabetes72,73.

Taken together, our work demonstrates the importance of Med15 and Mediator in the process of β-cell maturation, likely at least in part through mediating interactions between maturation transcription factor binding sites and core gene promoters. Further understanding how MED15 and Mediator regulate gene expression at regions that regulate β-cell maturation genes might allow for better in vitro production of β-cells with improved insulin secretion and understanding how its dysregulation could predispose to diabetes.
Methods
Animals and human islet studies

All mouse experiments were approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee. The Med15tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi mouse JM8A1.N3 embryonic stem cells used for this research project were obtained from the trans-NIH Knock-Out Mouse Project (KOMP) and obtained from the KOMP Repository (www.komp.org) and injected into B6-Alb 8-cell stage embryos that were implanted into pseudopregnant C57BL/6J females (Mouse Animal Production Service, Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics). Germline transmission of founders was confirmed by genotyping.

Animals were housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle, fed ad libitum with a standard chow diet (5010; Lab Diets). Mouse strains used were on the C57BL/6J background. Throughout this study, males were studied unless otherwise stated. Control mice were littermate Med15 fl/fl; Ins1+/+ or Med15+/+; Ins1Cre/+, whereas experimental mice were Med15 fl/fl; Ins1Cre/+. Mice were euthanized following UBC SOP 009E4 by carbon dioxide followed by cervical dislocation. Human islet studies were approved by the BC Children’s and Women’s Hospital Research Ethics Board. Human islets for research were provided by Prodo Labs, the University of Alberta Clinical Islet Transplantation Program74 or Alberta Diabetes Institute IsletCore at the University of Alberta in Edmonton (http://www.bcell.org/adi-isletcore.html) under written informed consent. The University of Alberta islet isolation facilities receive assistance from the Human Organ Procurement and Exchange (HOPE) program, Trillium Gift of Life Network (TGLN), and other Canadian organ procurement organizations. Islet isolation was approved by the Human Research Ethics Board at the University of Alberta (Pro00013094). All donors’ families gave informed consent for the use of pancreatic tissue in research.
Gene expression analyses

Human islets were washed with 1xPBS and placed in RLT buffer (QIAGEN 79216) containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich M6250), homogenized by vortexing, and hybridized to a custom CodeSet Plus chip. All probes are listed in Supplementary Data 3. CodeSet was then read on a Nanostring nCounter Sprint and analyzed using nSolver 3.0 for differential expression. Data was normalized by 6 housekeeping genes, including B2M, GAPDH, GUSB, HPRT1, POLR2A, and TBP. Significance was assessed by Student’s t-test for each probe.

Quantitative PCR was carried out as previously described75 using the following primers and probes labeled with FAM, ZEN, and Iowa Black FQ (IDT Technologies). Med15 (Forward: GAC CAC CAT CGG AGC AC; Reverse: TCA AAA CCA ACC ACC ACA GA; Probe: CCA CAG TCA CAG AGC CAG CCT TT), Med1 (Forward: CCA AAC AGC TGA CCA AAT GC; Reverse: CAG AAC AGA CCT TGG AGT GAA; Probe: ACC CTC TTC TCC ATT ACT TGA CGC AC), Med14 (Forward: GCC TTC TGT GTT TCC TCA CTT; Reverse: TGG TCT TCG ATT GGA GTT GTC; Probe: AGC CAT CAC CTT CCA CTT GCA CT), Med17 (Forward: CTT CTA ATT TTG TCT GCC AGT GTG; Reverse: TCT ATT CAG AAA CAG GCT CCA G; Probe: ACC TTT GCC /ZEN/CAA ATC CAA GCC AG), Med23 (Forward: CAC TGG ATT TCG TAT GAG CCA; Reverse: ACT CCC TTA CCG ATG AAC CT; Probe: CAT GCC AAG ATG AGC CTT ATT CAC AGC), MED15 (Forward: GAC CTG AGT AAG ATG AAG AGC C; Reverse: ACC GCC ATG TCA TTC TTG AG; Probe: TGT CCC CTG AAG ACC TTG CAA AAG T), UCN3 (Forward: CTT GGC TTT GTA GAA CTT GTG G; Reverse: CCT CCC TGA GCG TTT CG; Probe: AAG TGG ACC GGC ATC AGC ATC T), IAPP (Forward: TGC TGA TAT TGC TGA CAT TGA AAC; Reverse: TCC GCT TTT CCA CCT GAT G; Probe: TGG GCA TCC TGA AGC TGC AAG TA), NKX6-1 (Forward: TCG TTT GGC CTA TTC GTT GG; Reverse: TGT CTC CGA GTC CTG CTT C; Probe: TGC TTC TTC CTC CAC TTG GTC CG).
Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test

Following a 10-h fast during the dark cycle, mice were weighed, and fasting saphenous vein blood glucose levels were obtained using a OneTouch UltraMini glucometer (Lifescan). Two grams per kilogram of 40% w/v D-glucose was delivered via intraperitoneal injection, and blood glucose levels were determined at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min. Blood was collected at fasting and 10 min intraperitoneal glucose injection for determination of plasma insulin levels using ELISA (ALPCO STELLUX, 80-INSMR-CH10). Blood glucose levels greater than the glucometer detection limit are reported as 33.3 mM.
Insulin ELISA

A chemiluminescent ELISA kit (ALPCO STELLUX, 80-INSMR-CH10) was utilized according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Serum insulin samples were used directly. GSIS basal samples were used directly; 16 mM glucose incubation media were diluted 5×, 40 mM KCl incubation media were diluted 20×, and acid ethanol total insulin samples were diluted 200×. Briefly, 5 μL per well of samples and standards were loaded in two technical replicates, with standards for each separate plate used. Samples were incubated for 2 h on an orbital shaker at 850 RPM with insulin-antibody conjugate, washed 6 times, and incubated with substrate for 1 min. ELISA plates were read on a POLARstar Omega microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Guelph, ON, Canada) with 1 s integration time per well.
Morphometric analysis and immunofluorescence

Sixteen sections (250-μm intervals) of each pancreas were imaged on a BX61 widefield fluorescence microscope and tiled using the cellSens Dimension software (Olympus). CellProfiler v2.1.1 was used to quantify images, and counts were normalized to total pancreatic nuclei76. For validation of RNA-seq targets, sections were imaged using confocal microscopy (Leica SP8; Leica Microsystems) and counted as above. All insulin-positive (INS+) cells were normalized to the total number of DAPI+ cells counted.
Perifusion and static incubation insulin secretion assays

Perifusion insulin secretion was performed using a Perifusion V2.0.0 system (Biorep). To assess GSIS, islets were first perifused with 2.8 mM glucose in Krebs-ringer bicarbonate HEPES (KRBH; 114 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 4.7 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 0.2% BSA, pH 7.4) followed by 25 mM glucose; 10 mM α-ketoglutarate was used to bypass glucose uptake. Ten islets per well were removed to assess total insulin, removed, and transferred to 500 μL of acid ethanol (0.1 M HCl in 70% ethanol in H2O) and stored O/N at −20 °C. The remaining islets were then lysed in RIPA buffer, and DNA concentration was measured using a Qubit fluorometer.

For static incubation, 1 day prior to experiments, 804G matrix was deposited onto 12-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates. On the day of experiment, 804G matrix-coated wells were washed 3 times with sterile water and allowed to briefly air-dry. Then, 1 mL of RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS (Gibco LS10082147), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine was aliquoted into each well. Islets were isolated, and 50 size-matched islets were deposited per well and allowed to recover overnight. On the following day, islets were washed in PBS and pre-incubated in 500 μL of KRBH supplemented with 2.8 mM D-glucose for 1 h. After preincubation, the media was exchanged with 500 μL KRBH with 2.8 mM D-glucose and incubated again for 1 h for basal secreted insulin levels, and replaced with KRBH supplemented with 16 mM D-glucose or 40 mM KCl for 1 h for stimulated insulin levels. Finally, 10 islets per well were removed to assess total insulin, transferred to 500 μL of acid ethanol (0.1 M HCl in 70% ethanol in H2O), and stored at −20 °C. Remaining islets were washed with PBS, and cell lysate was collected for protein quantification.
Transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing

Following total RNA extraction and DNase treatment77, samples were rRNA depleted using a RiboGone™ Mammalian-Low Input Ribosomal RNA Removal Kit (Takara Bio USA 634847), Agencourt AMPure XP SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter A63881), and DynaMag-96 side magnet (ThermoFisher Scientific 12331D). rRNA-depleted RNA samples were assessed for rRNA depletion, RNA integrity, size distribution, and concentration prior to library generation with the Agilent RNA Pico 6000 kit on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies 5067-1511). rRNA-depleted RNA passing quality control was used in the SMARTer Stranded RNA-seq Kit (Takara Bio USA 634839). Following RNA incubation with stranded N6 primer, buffer, and water, samples were incubated at 94 °C for 4 min, appropriate for samples with RIN values between 4–7. Following purification of first-strand cDNA, libraries were PCR amplified in accordance with their input RNA amount, and purified. Final adapter-ligated cDNAs were quantified by Qubit® 3.0 dsDNA high-sensitivity assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific Q32854) together with qPCR amplification using standard curves of a known concentration of adapter-ligated libraries. Sequencing was performed on the NextSeq 500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with the High Output Reagent Cartridge v2 150 cycles (75 bp × 2).
Bioinformatics analysis

Linux Ubuntu operating system version 14.04 LTS was used for analyses. Fastq files from each sample were concatenated. ENSEMBL Mus musculus genome GRCm38p.4 fastq and gtf annotation file were used for alignments. STAR v2.4.0.178 was used to index the genome fastq files, align sample transcriptomes against the genome, and output as sorted by coordinate BAM files. Counts were generated from BAM files with HTSeq79 against annotated genes from GRCm38p.4. Differential gene analysis was performed between control and experimental samples using DESeq280, with an FPKM criteria of ≥5 in two or more samples, applying a Wald test on p-values from genes passing filtering, and adjusted for multiple testing via Benjamini and Hochberg procedure. Gene set enrichment analyses were performed with fgsea version 1.30.081.
Electron microscopy and insulin secretory granule quantification

Freshly isolated islets were placed in 2% fresh glutaraldehyde in PBS and prepared for transmission electron microscopy using a JEOL 1200EX TEMSCAN transmission electron microscope. For insulin secretory granule quantification, approximately 15–20 β-cells per genotype were analyzed on 10 random planes at 3000×. CellProfiler 3.0.0 was used to quantify granule counts and the size of halo around dense cores76.
Mitochondrial activity and 3D morphology measurements

Islets were washed with Minimum Essential Media (MEM, Corning #15-015-CV), dispersed with 0.05% trypsin, and seeded on 804G coated coverslips. The following day, the cells were pre-incubated 1 h with 2.8 mM glucose in KRBH. This was followed by 1.5 h incubation in 2.8 mM glucose, 18 mM glucose or 2.8 mM glucose + 10 mM α-ketoglutarate, with fluorescent 25 nM tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) (Sigma-Aldrich 87917), 50 nM mitotracker green FM (MTG) (ThermoFisher M7514) and 0.1 µg/mL Hoechst (ThermoFisher H3570) added the final 30 min. Cells were imaged in a Tokai Hit INUBTFP-WSKM stage-top incubator at 37 °C on a Leica SP8 Confocal Microscope (Concord, Ontario) using a 63XHC Plan Apochromatic water immersion objective (NA = 1.2). For 3D analysis, image stacks were acquired with z-spacing set to optimal Nyquist sampling parameters and deconvolved using Huygens Professional software (Scientific Volume Imaging, Netherlands). Mitochondrial morphological and functional features were extracted and quantified in ImageJ/Fiji using a mitochondria analyzer pipeline and plugin developed in-house82. Briefly, images were processed using the ImageJ Subtract Background and Sigma Filer Plus modules, and mitochondria were then identified using a local Weighted Mean-based threshold algorithm. 2D morphological descriptors were extracted from the resulting binary image using the Analyze Particles command, while 3D features were quantified using a combination of the 3D Object Counter and Particle Analyzer 3D commands (part of the MorphoLibJ package)83.
Seahorse mitochondrial function assay

Seahorse assay was performed as previously described84. In brief, Seahorse XFe96 spheroid microplates (Agilent, 102959-100) were coated with CellTak (ThermoFisher, C354240) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The following day, 10 size-matched islets in 15 μL of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine were gently deposited into the center of the spheroid wells with a canted P20 pipette tip. Islets attached overnight, with 6 technical replicates per animal, and 4 wells left as blanks with 175 μL prepared RPMI. The Seahorse sensor plate was prepared by adding 200 μL of buffer calibrant to the buffer cartridge. Sensor cartridge was placed into the buffer, mixed gently several times and placed into a 37 °C non-CO2 incubator overnight. Seahorse media was prepared fresh: Gibco D5030 with 2.8 mM glucose, 2 mM Glutamine, pH 7.4, and filter sterilized. Islets were washed by removing 150 μL of media with a multichannel pipette, working in groups. Seahorse media (175 μL) was replaced, removed again, and 150 μL of Seahorse media was added back for a final volume of 175 μL. Islets were incubated at 37 °C in a non-CO2 incubator for at least 1 h. Drugs were prepared in Seahorse media during this time as follows: 16 mM Glucose, FCCP (# 15218), Oligomycin Complex (# 11341), and antimycin A (# 2247) + Rotenone (# 13995) (Cayman Chemical Company; Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The Seahorse machine was run with the following measurement cycles: 5 cycles basal Seahorse media, 6 cycles 16 mM glucose, 4 cycles of oligomycin, 4 cycles of FCCP, 4 cycles of AA + Rotenone. Following measurements, islet images were captured on an Olympus inverted microscope and quantified for image area on ImagePro Analyzer (Mediacy, Rockville, MD, USA). Readings were then normalized to islet area.
Glucose uptake assay

Glucose uptake assay was performed as described85. In brief, islets were dispersed with trypsin and seeded on an 804 G coated coverslip. The following day, 2.8 mM glucose in KRBH was used to pre-incubate islet cells followed by 200 µM 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2deoxy-D-glucose (2-NBDG) for 10 min. Dispersed cells were imaged using confocal microscopy (Leica SP8; Leica Microsystems), and intracellular fluorescence was quantified with ImageJ software.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and analysis

Chromatin was isolated from MIN6 cells and fragmented using an M220 focused ultrasonicator with milliTUBE 1 mL with AFA fiber (Covaris, 520130), and chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out as described using MED15 (11566-AP; ProteinTech)86 or Med187 (A300-793A; Bethyl) antibodies. ChIP-seq libraries were constructed using a ThruPLEX DNA-seq Kit (R400427; Clontech). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 at 2x76bp.

Sequenced reads were quality trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.3988 using flags ‘2:30:10:2:True LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:35’. Trimmed reads were aligned to the mm10 genome using Bowtie2 v2.4.489 with flags ‘--very-sensitive --no-unal --no-discordant’. Aligned reads with mapping quality score <30, duplicate reads, reads that mapped to chromosomes X, Y, or M, and reads that mapped to annotated high-background regions90 were removed. Peaks were called using MACS3 v3.0.0a791 with flags ‘-f BAM -g mm -B -q 0.01’. Genome tracks were created by converting reads to bigwig file format (scaled to reads per million mapped reads) using BEDtools v2.26.092 genomecov and bedGraphToBigWig and visualizing in the Integrative Genomics Viewer93. Heatmaps were generated using deepTools v3.5.194. DNA motif analysis was performed using HOMER v4.11.1 findMotifsGenome with flags ‘-size 200 -mask’ and using the union of all Med1 and Med15 peaks as background. For the analyses using published transcription factor ChIP-seq data, bigwig files and BED files of peak locations were downloaded from the Cistrome data browser95. For the analyses using promoters and enhancers, promoter locations are the 5′ end of the Ensembl Canonical transcript ± 5 kb of genes detected in our RNA-seq data, and enhancers are FANTOM5 high-confidence CAGE-seq peak enhancer annotations96.
Co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro interaction studies

Co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) was carried out as described using MED15 antibody84. In brief, MIN6 cells were harvested with CoIP lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM NaF, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1x Roche protease inhibitor), insoluble material spun down, and supernatant collected. Protein concentration was determined via BCA assay (ThermoFisher, 23225), 10% of each lysate was set aside as input, and 2 µg antibody added to 300 µg lysate. Tubes were rotated overnight at 4 °C, 2 mg of magnetic Dynabeads were added, and bead-antigen-antibody complexes were washed 3 times with CoIP lysis buffer and separated. Then, 1% SDS was added to beads in CoIP lysis buffer, boiled for 10 min, and Western blot performed for target proteins.

In vitro interaction studies were performed with tagged proteins expressed by recombinant plasmids. To construct pCMV-mMed15-Flag-CT, primers 5′AATTGAATTCATGGACGTTTCGGGGCAGGAG and 5′TTAAGTCGACGGGAGCTGCAGCAGCCTTGA were used to amplify DNA fragment from mouse islet cDNAs. The PCR fragment was then digested with EcoR I and Sal I, and cloned into EcoR I and Sal I linearized pCMV-Flag-CT. To construct pcDNA3.1-HA-mNKX6.1, primers 5′AATTGAATTCATGGAGTACCCATACGACGTACCA and 5′ TTAACTCGAGTCAGGACGAGCCCTCGGCCTC were used to amply HA-mNKX6.1 fragment from plasmid pGADT7-newMCS-HA-mNKX6.1 that was generated by cloning mNKX6.1 cDNA into pGADT7-newMCS with Nde I and Xho I. The PCR fragment was digested with EcoR I and Xho I and cloned into EcoR I and Xho I linearized pcDNA3.1. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Then, HA-mNKX6.1 was expressed in 293T cells and purified with Pierce Anti-HA agarose (ThermoFisher cat#26181) and eluted with HA Synthetic Peptide (ThermoFisher Cat# 26184) according to the manufacturer's protocol. mMED15-FLAG or Ctrl-FLAG was expressed in 293T cells and immobilized on Pierce anti-Flag affinity resin (ThermoFisher cat#36801), which was followed by incubation with purified HA-mNKX6.1 eluted with HA peptide. Incubation was done at 4 °C overnight, which was followed by washing 6 times at 20 mMTris buffer pH 7.5 150 mM NaCl containing 0.5% NP-40. Bound HA-mNKX6.1 was examined by Western blot.
Alphafold and Alphapulldown

The multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and template features were generated through the AlphaFold/HHBlits databases51. Subsequent structure prediction was performed with MED15 (uniprot: Q96RN5) against each gene in Fig. S8A (baits, candidates as described)52. Figures 5 and S7 display the highest likelihood interaction for each relationship. The table in Fig. S7A provides quality and likelihood metrics (IPTM, PI_score, mpDockQ) calculated by AlphaPulldown, for the validity of the reported interface interaction. IPTM, interface protein TM scores range 0–1, with values >0.85 reliable to be defined as high-confidence PPI models97. pDockQ scores developed by Bryant et al.98 should be >0.23 for acceptable quality of the protein interface. PI scores, developed by Malhotra et al.99, are binary classifiers with positive values corresponding to native-like structures. PI score calculation produces additional metrics, such as contact pairs and hydrogen bonds, relating to the number of each interaction at less than seven Angstroms between interfaces and is helpful in understanding the predicted interface.
CRISPR knock-in and hESC differentiation

The CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to generate MED15βOE hESC line as previously described using pCCC to express gRNA (5′-TGCAACTAGACGCAG CCCGC-3′) and Cas953. Electroporation, selection, picking, and expansion of clones was previously described53 with the following changes: StemFlex Medium (Gibco) was used for clonal expansion and cell culture, and the following primers were used for genotyping across the homology arms: LL688, TGACCGCAGATTCAAGTGTT; LL814, GTCAGGCTCTGGAGTGCATT; LL789, GAAGGATTGGAGCTACGGGG; LL790, AGCTCATGGTGCCATCTGAC. Positive clones were subjected to Sanger sequencing to confirm fidelity of recombination and tested for chromosomal abnormalities using the hPSC Genetic Analysis Kit and the manufacturer’s instructions (STEMCELL Technologies #07550). Genetically modified hESCs were differentiated as spheroids as recently described54,55.
Data analyses

Measurements were performed on independent samples unless otherwise specified, with one biological replicate being defined as one mouse, one cell passage or one stem cell differentiation. Sex-specific analyses were carried out for many mouse studies, as noted in the figures; human islets gene expression studies were not segregated or analyzed by sex, although age, sex and BMI of the organ donors may be found in Supplementary Data S1. The majority of experimental approaches included technical replicates, and these were typically averaged and reported as 1 biological replicate unless otherwise noted. Throughout, we report results from at least 3 biological replicates. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) or R version 4.2.3. Statistical significance was determined using parametric (Student’s t-test or ANOVA) or non-parametric (Mann–Whitney U-test or Kruskal–Wallis), permutation, or Fisher exact tests with appropriate post-hoc tests, as noted in figure legends. Unless otherwise noted in figure legends, a p-value <0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference (*) between groups. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM.
