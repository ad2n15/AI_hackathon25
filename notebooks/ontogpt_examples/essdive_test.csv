Methods summarized:,
"Study sites: Fine roots were sampled from four lowland tropical forests in central Panama, representing variations in rainfall and soil fertility. The sites (GIG, P12, P13, SC) were part of a long-term forest dynamics study near the Barro Colorado Nature Monument (BCNM). Soil fertility was classified based on previous measurements of resin-extractable P and base cations. Sampling was conducted from late 2017 to 2018, during the wet and transition seasons, from 8 plots per site (n=32 total). 
Root collection and processing: Root cores were taken using a 5-cm diameter hand auger in 10-cm increments down to 1.2 m. Samples were cleaned, classified into fine (<2 mm) and coarse (>2 mm) roots, and separated into live or dead roots. 
Root morphology: Live fine roots were scanned using a Microtek 9800XL plus-Microtek-TMA 1600 II scanner to measure root morphology via WinRHIZO software (Regent Instruments, Canada). 
Elemental Analyses: Live fine roots were analyzed for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content using a Carlo-Erba NA1500 elemental analyzer at the Environmental Stable Isotope Laboratory, Duke University, USA. 
NMR Analyses: Fine root organic chemistry from surface live fine roots (0-10 cm depth) was assessed using 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This analysis was performed using a 300 MHz Bruker Avance III NMR spectrometer at Baylor University, which provided insights into the chemical composition of fine roots across the forest sites.
AMF Colonization: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization was determined through root staining and microscopy. Roots were cleared, stained with trypan blue, and analyzed using the gridline-intersect method to estimate the percentage of root length containing AMF structures. ",
