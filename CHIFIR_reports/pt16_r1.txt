CLINICAL NOTES:   Odynophagia/dysphagia. Oesoph 25-35cm scarred, friable, ulcerated.   MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:   1.  30cm Bx"":  Two mucosal fragments each 3-5mm.  A1.    2.  ""Gastric Bx"":  Two""        
mucosal fragments each 2-4mm.  A1.    3.  Duodenum Bx"":  Three mucosal fragments each 2-4mm.  A1.  (MM)   MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:   1.  Sections show ulcerated squamous mucosa with underlying""        
lamina  propria.  The squamous epithelium demonstrates marked hyperplasia, moderate spongiosis and scattered intraepithelial inflammatory cells. The lamina propria contains a moderately dense mixed        
acute and chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate.  No fungi or viral inclusions are seen. There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.  Immunostains for HSV1&2 are negative.  The Gram stain shows        
gram  positive cocci and bacilli.  The Grocott stain shows fungal yeasts.  2.  Sections show gastric antral type mucosa and body type mucosa. The foveolar and glandular architecture appears well        
maintained.   There are no increased intraepithelial inflammatory cells.  No  Helicobacter are identified.  The lamina propria contains scant  chronic inflammatory cells.  No acute or granulomatous        
inflammation is seen.  There is no evidence of intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia or  malignancy.   3.  Sections show duodenal mucosa including muscularis mucosae and  Brunner's glands.  The villous        
and gland architecture appears well  maintained.  There are no increased intraepithelial lymphocytes.  The  lamina propria contains a normal complement of chronic inflammatory  cells.  No acute or        
granulomatous inflammation is seen.  There is no  evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.   DIAGNOSIS:   1.  Oesophagus, 30cm biopsy:  Ulcerated squamous mucosa; bacteria and        
fungi identified.  2.  Stomach, biopsy:  No diagnostic abnormality recognised.    3.  Duodenum, biopsy:  No diagnostic abnormality recognised.   SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT: Dr XXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX   Specimen 1: CMV immunostain result = NEGATIVE."
