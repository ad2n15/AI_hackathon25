CLINICAL NOTES: 
Recent BM Tx. ? GVHD. Flex Sig - descending/sigmoid ulceration + erythema, rectum normal. 

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: 
1. ""Descending colon Bx"": Three grey tissue fragments 3-4mm. A1. 

2. ""Sigmoid Bx"": Two grey tissue fragments 2-6mm. A1. 

3. ""Rectal Bx"": Two grey tissue fragments 5-6mm. A1. (XX) 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: 
1. Sections show fragments of large bowel mucosa including muscularis mucosae. There is a focus of ulceration. The lamina propria appears within normal limits. Crypt architecture is also within normal limits. Crypt epithelium shows a few apoptoses 
at the mid-crypt and basal regions. There is no evidence of malignancy. No viral inclusion seen. 

2. Sections show fragments of large bowel mucosa including muscularis mucosae. Crypt architecture is within normal limits. There is a focal mixed infiltrate of neutrophils, eosinophils and mononuclear chronic inflammatory cells which involves the 
lamina propria and a few crypts. There are a few crypt base apoptoses. There is no evidence of malignancy. . No viral inclusion seen. 

3. Sections show fragments of large bowel mucosa including muscularis mucosae. Crypt architecture is within normal limits. There is no significant inflammation and no apoptoses seen. No viral inclusion seen. 

Immunohistochemistry for CMV, HSV1 and HSV2 are negative in specimens 1-3. 

DIAGNOSIS: 
1. Descending colon Bx: Apoptotic colopathy and ulceration. 
2. Sigmoid Bx: Focal acute colitis. 
3. Rectal Bx: Normal large bowel mucosa. 


COMMENT: 
Focal acute colitis in the sigmoid colon is suggestive of an infectious aetiology. The descending colon biopsy suggests that there may be superimposed graft versus host disease as well. "
