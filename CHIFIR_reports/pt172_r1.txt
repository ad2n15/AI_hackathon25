CLINICAL NOTES: 

Endoscopic biopsy. 
Allograft patient, from India, upper GI symptoms.  

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: 

1. ""Gastric biopsy"": Four tissue fragments 2-6mm. A1.  

2. ""Duodenal biopsy"": Tan tissue fragment 4mm. A1. (XX) 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: 

1. Sections show gastric body mucosa to muscularis mucosae with normal foveolar architecture. There are no intraepithelial neutrophils and there is no intraepithelial lymphocytosis. The lamina propria is normocellular. There is no evidence of 
Helicobacter, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia or malignancy. Acid-fast organisms are not seen with ZN stain. CMV and HSV immunohistochemistry is negative. 

2. Sections show duodenal mucosa to muscularis mucosae with Brunner's glands and mildly short and wide villous architecture. Villus to crypt ratio is approximately 1:1. There are no intraepithelial neutrophils and there is no intraepithelial 
lymphocytosis. The lamina propria has a moderate population of lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils. There is no active inflammation. There is no evidence of parasites, dysplasia or malignancy. Acid-fast organisms are not seen with 
ZN stain. CMV and HSV immunohistochemistry is negative.
